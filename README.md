# HushBot
A Discord bot made to control the Lovense Hush device.

# Setup
Setting up HushBot is fairly simple.
You will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) v16.0.0 or higher installed. Once you have that done, you can edit the `config.json` file.
You will then need to install all dependencies using `npm install`.
Starting HushBot should be done using the `main.js` file.


> The code is rather "what the fuck is this?" as I made it a while ago and wanted to get it done fast.
